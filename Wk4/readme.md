# WEEK 4
Configure Jira II
In this module, we continue configuring Jira in order to be able to match the tool to our team's custom agile process. We will discuss and create epics, which are large issues that may contain other issues. We will discuss and create versions, which are a set of issues that usually make up a product update. We discuss users and permissions. Since you are the administrator of the free Jira Software Cloud that you use for this course, you should know how to invite users to your site and configure permissions so that the right access is granted to users. We end the course with a final project. You will be asked to configure Jira to keep up with your team's continuous changes to their agile process.
